Glimpse's profile management features can be accessed through the user profile dropdown menu located at the top-right corner. These features allow users to update their name, email address, and profile photo.

## Email Verification

Glimpse includes support for requiring that a newly registered user verify their email address. After registering, the user will receive an email with a link to verify their email address. Once the user clicks the link, they will be prompted to enter their email address to verify it. If the email address is verified, the user will be able to log in to Glimpse.

<Warning>
  If you have not verified your email address, you will not be able to log in to Glimpse.
</Warning>

## Profile Photo

You can upload a profile photo to your account by clicking the `Upload Photo` button. The photo will be uploaded to Glimpse and displayed on your profile page.

<Warning>
  The profile photo will be displayed on your profile page and in the Glimpse dashboard. It will not be displayed on your team's dashboard.
</Warning>

## Account Deletion

If you no longer wish to use Glimpse, you can delete your account by clicking the `Delete Account` button. This will delete all of your data from Glimpse and cannot be undone.

## Two Factor Authentication

Glimpse provides robust two-factor authentication (2FA) support to enhance the security of your account. You can access the 2FA settings through the user profile dropdown menu located at the top-right corner of the dashboard. Within this section, you will find options to enable and manage two-factor authentication for your account.

<Info>
To enable two-factor authentication, you will need to scan the provided QR code using a TOTP authenticator application such as Google Authenticator. Additionally, it is highly recommended to store the recovery codes in a secure password manager like 1Password.
</Info>

In the event that you lose access to your mobile device, you can use one of the recovery codes to authenticate and regain access to your account. This ensures that you can still log in even if you are unable to use the authenticator application on your mobile device.
