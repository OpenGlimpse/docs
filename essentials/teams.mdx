Technically all Glimpse accounts belong to a team. The Team plan allows you to collaborate on your preview environments with other users.

## Billing

Billing is handled through your team. Only team owners can manage billing settings. To access the billing portal, click `Billing settings` in team dropdown next to your profile picture.

<Tip>
  You can also access the billing portal directly by visiting the [billing](/billing) link.
