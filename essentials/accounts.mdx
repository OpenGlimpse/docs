Glimpse keeps track of your repositories through your GitHub account and installation. This allow you to connect multiple GitHub accounts to your Glimpse team.

To connect additional GitHub installations, use the account switcher in the top left corner of the Glimpse dashboard and click `Connect account`. You will then be redirected to GitHub to authorize Glimpse to access your account.

After installation, you will be redirected back to Glimpse where the installation will be verified, and the selected repositories will be listed. From there, you can select
which repositories you want to connect to Glimpse.

To manage your GitHub installation, visit the team integrations page in your teams settings.
