Glimpse integrates with a variety of tools and services to enhance your development experience. These integrations allow you to seamlessly communicate deployment statuses with a variety of tools, such as GitHub, Slack, and more.

## GitHub

Glimpse integrates with GitHub's oauth authentication to allow users to connect their GitHub account to Glimpse.
This integration allows users to authenticate with GitHub using their existing GitHub account, and then authorize Glimpse to access their GitHub repositories.

### GitHub App

Glimpse has an official GitHub app that must be installed to give Glimpse access to your GitHub repositories.

<Info>
  You can install the GitHub app from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/glimpse-sh/installations/new).
</Info>

Once the GitHub app is installed, you will be able to connect and configure your repositories from the Glimpse dashboard.

## Slack

Glimpse integrates with Slack using webhooks to allow users to receive notifications in their Slack workspace.
This integration enables Glimpse to send deployment status updates and other relevant information directly to your specified Slack channels.

To set up the Slack integration, you'll need to create an incoming webhook for your Slack workspace.

<Info>
  You can learn how to create a Slack webhook in the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
</Info>

Once you've created a webhook, you can add it to your Glimpse repository settings. This will allow Glimpse to send notifications to your specified Slack channel whenever there's a relevant update or event.

## Linear

Glimpse integrates with Linear to allow users to connect their Linear account to Glimpse.
This integration allows users to authenticate with Linear using their existing Linear account, and then authorize Glimpse to access their Linear workspace.

Glimpse has an official Linear app that must be installed to give Glimpse access to your Linear workspace.

<Info>
  You can install the Linear app from the [Linear Marketplace](https://linear.app/marketplace/apps/glimpse-sh).
</Info>

Once the Linear app is installed, Glimpse will automatically post comments to the associate Linear issue with a link to your preview environments.
