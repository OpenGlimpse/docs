## Connect your Laravel Forge account

Glimpse uses your Laravel Forge account to create isolated preview environments for your pull requests. To connect your Forge account, follow these steps:

### Create a Forge token

Head over to your [Forge API tokens](https://forge.laravel.com/user-profile/api) and create a new token. Give it a name and click the `Create` button. Copy the token and save it somewhere safe.

### Add your Forge token to Glimpse

You can paste your Forge token into the input field for your Server Provider on the [onboarding](https://glimpse.sh/onboarding) page.

If you need to update your Forge token, you can visit your team settings page and navigate to the Integrations tab.

## Authorize GitHub

You must authorize Glimpse to access your GitHub account. To do this, visit the [onboarding](https://glimpse.sh/onboarding) page and click the `Connect` button.

If you need to update your GitHub token, you can do so from your [profile](https://glimpse.sh/user/profile) page in the Glimpse dashboard.

## Install the Glimpse GitHub app

The official Glimpse GitHub app manages access to your public and private repositories. To install the GitHub app, click the `Install` button on the [onboarding](https://glimpse.sh/onboarding) page.

You can manage your GitHub app from your team settings page and navigating to the Integrations tab.

## Connect your repository

Once you have provided your Forge token and have GitHub authorized and installed, you can connect your repository to Glimpse. To do this, visit the [onboarding](https://glimpse.sh/onboarding) page and click the `Connect Repository` button.

You can also connect a repository by clicking the `Connect repository` button in the navigation menu.
