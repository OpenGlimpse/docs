---

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have a Glimpse account configured to use GitHub and Laravel Forge, and connected your repository.
</Info>

Glimpse automatically deploys your pull requests to your Forge server. This allows you to preview your changes before merging them into your main branch. When a pull request is
created or updated, you should see the following comment in the pull request:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/deployment-started-comment.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

When a pull request is opened, Glimpse handles the following:

1. **Install Git Repository**: It installs the Git repository on the newly created site.

2. **Update Deployment Script**: If the repository has a custom deployment script, Glimpse updates the deployment script on the site.

3. **Update Environment Variables**: Glimpse updates the environment variables on the site with the values specified in the repository configuration.

4. **Enable SSL**: If the repository uses HTTPS, Glimpse obtains a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for the site.

5. **Enable Security Rule**: If the repository has a security rule configured, Glimpse enables the security rule on the site.

6. **Deploy Site**: Glimpse deploys the site on Forge.

7. **Generate App Key**: It generates a new application key for the site.

8. **Enable Quick Deploy**: Glimpse enables quick deploy for the site, allowing future deployments to be triggered automatically.

9. **Enable Horizon and Pulse**: If the repository has Horizon or Pulse enabled, Glimpse sets up the necessary daemons on the site.

<Tip>
  Unlimited repositories available under the [Tea
  Plan](https://glimpse.sh/pricing)

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:
